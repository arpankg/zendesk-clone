1. When I ask you to include logs, make sure you use emojis and detailed log messages so I can visually distinguish between log operations. Make sure you include relevant variables in the log messages and that you format them properly so it's easy to read the log messages.
2. Add new lines after the log messages so that it's easier to read them.
3. If you do not know the answer, say so instead of guessing.
4. Focus on easy-to-understand and readable code over what is performant.
5. Always use Tailwindcss classes for styling HTML.
6. Use long, descriptive variable and function names. Be consistent.
7. The database schema is in DATABASE.md. Make sure you check this when you're using the Supabase database.
8. I use `bun` not `npm`. Make sure you use bun instead of npm for terminal commands.
